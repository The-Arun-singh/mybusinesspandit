                    <h2>PF REGISTRATION</h2>
                    <p>An Employment Provident Fund (i.e. EPF) is a retirement perk that is usable by all salaried employees. 
                        This reserve is controlled and supervised by the EPFO (i.e. the Employees Provident Fund Organisation of India). 
                        Any organisation employing 20 employees or more is needed to register under the EPFO as per our legal framework. 
                        Contribution to the PF account is mandatory for each employee earning a basic salary up to INR 6500. It is simply 
                        a savings medium that enables employees to set aside a fraction of their resource each month. The amount so 
                        gathered can be utilised in a situation if the employee is concluded inefficient to work or upon withdrawal 
                        (whatever is early). Once a person starts working, both the employer as well as the employee have to add 
                        (3.67% is contribute by the former and 8.33 by the later)12% of the basic salary along with dearness allowance 
                        (in case any) into the EPF account. The ROI (i.e. rate of interest) on PF is 8.5% p.a.
