                    <h2>IMPORT EXPORT CODE</h2>
                        <p>In this age of cut – throat competition everyone wants to grow their business beyond the limits beyond the limits of the domestic market. 
                            However , doing business globally isn’t just a cup of tea for everyone. Before going global, you need to follow several procedures and 
                            laws in place and get diffrent registration and license. IEC (Import And Export ) license is one of such prerequisities when you’re 
                            thinking of important or exporting from india. it is also known as Importer – Exporter Code. <br>
                            IEC ( Import Export Code ) is required by anyone who is looking to kick – start his / her import /export business in the country. 
                            It is issued by the DGFT ( Director General Of Foreign Trade ). IEC is a 10 digit code which has a lifetime validity. Predominantly 
                            importers merchant cannot import goods without the Import Export Code and similarly, the exporter merchant cannot avail benefits from 
                            DGFT for the export scheme, etc. without IEC.
