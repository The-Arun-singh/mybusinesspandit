                                permits and licenses. Even though you might have an ISO certification, you still need government and authority permission, permits and

                                time required for the ISO registration depends upon the organization.

                            <p class="answer"> People often say “ISO Certified” but ISO does not issue certificates or 
                                certify individual companies to any standard. So who can Grant ISO 9001 Certification? They are issued by certification/registration 
                                bodies (also called Registrars or CB’s), which are independent of ISO.
