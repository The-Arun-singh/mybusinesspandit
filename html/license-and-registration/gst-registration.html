                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>GST or Goods and Services Tax was introduced by the Indian Government to regulate prices throughout the country and remove all 
                        state or central Government imposed indirect taxes on goods and services by initiating GST registration in India. As per the 
                        recently amended notification in 2019, businesses whose turnover exceeds Rs.40 lakhs (Rs. 20 lakhs for North East and hill 
                        states) is required to get their GST as a normal taxable person and hence needs to mandatorily apply for GST Registration. 
                        Apart from the above turnover bracket, there are certain instances where GST registration is mandatory for those individuals 
                        or entities who are engaged in the supply of goods or services across the state. You can apply for online GST Registration 
                        either as a normal taxpayer or under the GST composition scheme. Taxpayers with a turnover of less than Rs.1.5 crore can 
                        opt for composition scheme to get rid of monotonous GST formalities and pay GST at a fixed rate of turnover.The procedure 
                        for GST is entirely online and requires no manual interference.Once the registration is done under GST, you will get a 
                        unique GSTIN (Goods and Service Tax Identification Number). The Central Government issues a state-wise, 15-digit number 
                        to you once the registration is done. There are several advantages of GST registration including the fact that you will 
                        get a legal identity as a supplier. Furthermore, you can also getan input tax credit and collect GST from the final 
                        recipients of goods and services.</p>

                            <p>One of the major benefits of GST is the elimination of numerous indirect taxes that existed earlier. Now, 
                                many taxes have been replaced. Taxes including excise, octroi, sales tax, Service tax, CENVAT, turnover 
                                tax etc. are no more applicable and all those have come under common tax called GST.</p>

                            <p>Application of GST has resulted in the elimination of double charging in the system for a common man. Due 
                                to GST, the price of goods and services has reduced & ultimately helping the common man saving more money.</p>

                            <p>GST is applicable at all stages, right from manufacturing to consumption, it is providing tax credit benefits 
                                at every stage in the chain. In the earlier scenario, at every stage, the margin used to get added and 
                                tax was paid on the whole amount. Under GST the businesses are taking benefit of Input Tax Credit and 
                                tax is being paid on the amount of value addition only. GST has reduced the cascading effect of tax 
                                thereby reducing the cost of the product.</p>

                            <p>Since GST has reduced the cost of products, the demand, for some – if not all, products have increased. 
                                With the increase in demand, to meet the increase in supply, the employment opportunitieshave started
