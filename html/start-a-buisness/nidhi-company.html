                        <h2>ADVANTAGES</h2>
                        <p>Following are some of the advantages of forming a Nidhi 
                            Company in India:</p>

                            <h3>Limited Liability:</h3>
                            <p>Liability of Directors and shareholders of the Nidhi Company are limited as per the Companies Act, 2013. In case the company 
                                grieves from any loss or faces financial distress in the course of its business activity, the personal assets of any of the 
                                Directors or members are not at risk of being held by banks, creditors, and government. The liability of the members is 
                                only for the unpaid amount on shares held by them and not more than that. Shareholders are not liable for the Company’s 
                                debts and liabilities.</p>

                            <h3>Separate Legal Entity</h3>
                            <p>One of the best advantages of a Nidhi Company is that it is distinct from that of its members. A company is a separate entity 
                                having its own rights & Obligations.</p>

                            <p>Nidhi Company initially can be registered by at least seven persons, by complying with the prescribed limited formalities 
                                of the Companies Act, 2013 and Nidhi companies Rules, 2014.</p>

                            <p>Registering Nidhi Company is quite cost-efficient. The minimum capital requirement for registration of Nidhi Company is Rs 5,00, 000 lakh.</p>

                            <h3>Limited Regulations</h3>
                            <p>Nidhi companies follow the Nidhi Rules, 2014 issued by the Central Government in respect of its activities. Regulations imposed on Nidhi 
                                Company by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is very limited.</p>

                            <h3>Lower rate of credit</h3>
                            <p>The loans given to the members are at a much lower rate of interest than the market rate. This ultimately brings much more 
                                savings to the members.</p>

                            <p>The goal of Nidhi companies is to promote the habit of savings and thrifts amongst the lower and the middle section of the society. 
                                These small sections of the population contribute to the funds and avail the credit from the Nidhi Companies as and when required.</p>

                            <p>The Nidhi Companies are formed, managed and provide benefits only to their members. The outsider will not be allowed to get 
                                involved in Nidhi company operations in anyways. Be it working off the Nidhi companies or depositing money with them or even 
                                avail credit from Nidhi. There would be no external intervention in the management as well.</p>

                            <h3>Cheaper to Borrow</h3>
                            <p>As a member, one can borrow money at a minimum rate, relative to the rate at which banks lend money. This can be a major 
                                advantage in times of need, as different individuals in the mutual benefit society are likely to need funds at 
                                different points in time.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>Fewer Complications</h3>
                            <p>Borrowing and lending to known persons, where the procedure is fixed, is much less complicated than dealing with banks or 
                                in an informal setting. A Nidhi Company enables its members to unlock the potential of their money and gain from lower 
                                interest rates when they require money themselves.</p>
