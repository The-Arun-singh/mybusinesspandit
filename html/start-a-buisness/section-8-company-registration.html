                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Foreign Donations:</strong> Foreign donations are allowed only when FCRA (Foreign Contribution Regulation Act 1976) registration has been taken. FCRA license can only be applied after 3-years from the date of registration.

                        <li><strong>Domestic donations:</strong> There is no limitation to the domestic donations. But to avoid money laundering cases, a proper system must be laid down to keep them in check.</li>
