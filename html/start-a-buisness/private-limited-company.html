                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    A Private Limited Company Registration is the most popular form of corporate legal registration in India. 
                    A private limited company is a company which is privately held for small businesses. The liability of the 
                    members of a Private Limited Company is limited to the amount of shares respectively held by them.Shares of 
                    Private Limited Company cannot be publically traded. It can be initiated with a minimum of two Directors 
                    (Individuals only) and two Shareholders (Individuals or Corporate entities). Both Directors and Shareholders 
                    may or may not be the same person. <br>
                    Private Limited Company is preferred as it ensures limited liability and provides a separate legal entity 
                    to the business. The company incorporation procedure results in clear ownership of the company defined by 
                    the share capital. Incorporation of a company is the first step in scaling your business as it paves the 
                    way for outside funding while enabling you to attract top talent by offering stock options. However, one 
                    needs to take into account mandatory audits and higher compliance which could be tough to maintain. On the 
                    other hand, higher compliance will lend better credibility to your business than any other form of incorporation 
                    of a company in India.

            <div class="advantages">
                <h2>ADVANTAGES</h2>
                <p>Not just one or two but there are numerous reasons why you should go for private limited company registration. Let’s find out what they are:</p>
                <div class="cells">
                    <div class="cell">
                        <h3>Simple Registration Process</h3>
                        <p>Private Limited Company can be registered by just two or more persons, by complying with the prescribed limited formalities as per the 
                            Companies Act, 2013.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="cell">
                        <h3>Limited Liability</h3>
                        <p>Limited liability is one of the greatest advantages of a Private Limited Company. If any legal liability arises, 
                            then neither it’s member nor it’s director’s personally affected; the Liability of the members is only for the 
                            npaid amount on shares held by them and not more than that. Shareholders are not liable for the Company’s debts 
                            and liabilities.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="cell">
                        <h3>Separate Legal Entity</h3>
                        <p>One of the most interesting advantagesof a Private Limited Company is that it is distinct from that of its members. 
                            A company is a separate entity having its rights & Obligations.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="cell">
                        <h3>Perpetual Succession</h3>
                        <p>A company with ‘perpetual succession’, has continued or uninterrupted existence until it is legally shut down. 
                            The Company, being a separate legal entity, is not affected by the death of any member but continues to be in existence.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="cell">
                        <h3>Easy Transferability</h3>
                        <p>Shares of a Private Limited Companyare easily transferable by a member to any other person. No complicated formalities are there.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="cell">
                        <h3>Owning Property</h3>
                        <p>A company is a separate legal person, can purchase, own, enjoy and alienate or sale, property in its name. No member or shareholder 
                            can make any claim upon the property of the company so long as the company is a going concern.</p>

                                <p>No. Company law is different from trademark law. You cannot stop someone using a trademark 
                                which is the same or similar to yours merely by registering your name with Companies House.</p>

                                <p>The directors are responsible for the day to day running of the company and ensuring it 
                                meets its responsibilities and deadlines. The shareholders own the company and have the right to vote 
                                on many issues. The extent of ownership 
                                and level of voting rights are based on the percentage of issued shares they own. An individual can be
                                    both a director and shareholder of a company.</p>

                                    documentation to Companies House:

                                <p>Yes, a Foreign National or an NRI can be a Director of a Private Limited Company in India after obtaining 
                                    Director Identification Number.
