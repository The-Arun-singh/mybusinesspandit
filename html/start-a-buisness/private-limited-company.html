                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        A Private Limited Company Registration is the most popular form of corporate legal registration in India. 
                        A private limited company is a company which is privately held for small businesses. The liability of the 
                        members of a Private Limited Company is limited to the amount of shares respectively held by them.Shares of 
                        Private Limited Company cannot be publically traded. It can be initiated with a minimum of two Directors 
                        (Individuals only) and two Shareholders (Individuals or Corporate entities). Both Directors and Shareholders 
                        may or may not be the same person. <br>
                        Private Limited Company is preferred as it ensures limited liability and provides a separate legal entity 
                        to the business. The company incorporation procedure results in clear ownership of the company defined by 
                        the share capital. Incorporation of a company is the first step in scaling your business as it paves the 
                        way for outside funding while enabling you to attract top talent by offering stock options. However, one 
                        needs to take into account mandatory audits and higher compliance which could be tough to maintain. On the 
                        other hand, higher compliance will lend better credibility to your business than any other form of incorporation 
                        of a company in India.

                            <p>Limited liability is one of the greatest advantages of a Private Limited Company. If any legal liability arises, 
                                then neither it’s member nor it’s director’s personally affected; the Liability of the members is only for the
