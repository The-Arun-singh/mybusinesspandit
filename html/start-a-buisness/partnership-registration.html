                            <h3>EASY TO FORM</h3>
                            <p>Like sole proprietorships, partnership businesses can be formed easily without any compulsory legal formalities. 
                                It is not necessary to get the firm registered. A simple agreement or partnership deed, either oral or in writing, 
                                is sufficient to create a partnership. Registration of the partnership is voluntary in most states. However, it 
                                would be best to check up the rules of your state to be sure. In states like Maharashtra, registration is almost compulsory.</p>

                            <h3>AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES</h3>
                            <p>Since two or more partners join hands to start a partnership business, it may be possible to pool together more resources as 
                                compared to a sole proprietorship. The partners can contribute more capital, more effort and more time for the business.</p>

                        <div class="cell c3">
                            <h3>BETTER DECISIONS</h3>
                            <p>The partners are the owners of the business. Each of them has equal right to participate in the management of the business. 
                                In case of any conflict, they can sit together to solve the problem. Since all partners participate in the decision-making process, 
                                there is less scope for reckless and hasty decisions.</p>

                            <p>A partnership firm is a flexible organization. At any time, the partners can decide to change the size or nature of the business 
                                or area of it’s operation. There is no need to follow any legal procedure. Consent of all the partners is required only.</p>

                            <h3>SHARING RISKS</h3>
                            <p>In a partnership firm all the partners “share” the business risks. Because of this, the partners may 
                                be encouraged to take up more risk and hence expand their business more.</p>

                            <p>In a partnership firm, every partner has an equal right in decision making and the management of the business. 
                                If any decision goes against the interest of any partner, he can prevent the decision from being taken.</p>

                    <h2>BENEFITS OF SPECIALIZATION</h2>
                    <p>Since all the partners are owners of the business, they can actively participate in every aspect of business as per their specialization, 
                        knowledge and experience. If you want to start a firm to provide legal consultancy to people, then one partner may deal with civil cases, 
                        one in criminal cases, and another in labour cases and so on as per the individual specialization. Similarly, two or more doctors of 
                        different specialization may start a clinic in partnership.</p>
