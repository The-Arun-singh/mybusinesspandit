                    <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
                    <p>
                        Proprietorship is such kind of form of business which is run by a single 
                        person who is known as the proprietor. Proprietorship form of business is 
                        the most common form of business which is used in India by merchants and 
                        small traders. Such business has very less regulatory compliances. However, 
                        there is no standard way available to register proprietorship by Indian Government. 
                        It is identified through alternate registrations, such as GST registrations etc. However, 
                        its liability is unlimited and it also doesn’t have perpetual existence. Hence, following 
                        registrations can be done to show the existence of your proprietorship business:
                    </p>
                    <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>GST Registration</li>
                            <li>Professional Tax Registration</li>
                            <li>Shop and Establishment Registration</li>
                            <li>MSME Registration</li>
                        </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The owner of a sole proprietorship business signs contracts in his or her own name, 
                        because the sole proprietorship business has no separate identity under the law. The 
                        sole proprietor owner will have customers write cheques in the owner’s name, even if 
                        the business uses a fictional name. Sole proprietor owners can, and often do, mix 
                        personal and business property and funds, something that partnerships, LLCs and 
                        corporations cannot do. Sole proprietorships often have their bank accounts in the name of 
                        the owner. Sole proprietors need not observe formalities such as voting and meetings associated 
                        with the more complex business forms. Sole proprietorships can bring lawsuits (and can be sued) 
                        using the name of the sole proprietor owner.

                        <h2>ADVANTAGES</h2>
                        <p>Now, let's discuss the advantages of a Sole Proprietorship:</p>
                    </div>
                    <hr>
                    <div class="cells">
                        <div class="cell c1">
                            <h3>Easy to start</h3>
                            <p>Sole Proprietorships do not require compulsory registrations under any law. They only require registrations or licenses which are specific as per the nature of business. So, any person can start his/her business easily with a trade name of his/her choice. Any trade name can be used but it must not be similar to the already registered brand name. However, the name does not require any kind of approval from the registry. Further, they do not involve any complexities as they are handled and managed by a single person.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="cell c2">
                            <h3>Low Investment</h3>
                            <p>Sole Proprietorship business can be started with a very low amount as it does not require huge investment. Hence, it is a great opportunity for those who want to set up their own business with less amount of fund as there is no criteria of requirement of minimum capital.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="cell c3">
                            <h3>No sharing of Profits</h3>
                            <p>Since sole proprietor is the only person who operates and manage the complete business. Hence, whatever profit is earned, completely belongs to the sole proprietor and no other person is entitled to receive such profit.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="cell c4">
                            <h3>Less Compliances</h3>
                            <p>Since sole proprietorship as such is not governed under any law, hence there are less number of legal compliances. Also, the compliances depend upon the registration or licenses which they have taken for their sole proprietorship business. For example, if the sole proprietorship has taken registration under GST law, then it needs to comply with GST compliances like GST Return filing etc.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="cell c5">
                            <h3>Relatively inexpensive to form</h3>
                            <p>As compared to OPC, the Sole Proprietorship business is relatively inexpensive. There's no need for hiring an auditor or anybody else which saves a lot of costs. Apart from this, it saves the business from other investments as well which are mandatory for other business entities.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="cell c6">
                            <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
                            <p>Businesses which have more than one member are prone to data theft and information leakage. However, in Proprietorship, there's only one person who has complete control over the business. Therefore, there's no chance of any data leakage or theft. The things are completely confidential and are limited to the only person who manages it.</p>

                    <p>
                        As discussed before, starting a sole proprietorship business is quite easy and less expensive. There are only two things that you need to do while starting a sole proprietorship business in India. They are as follows:
                    </p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Selection of name for your business which is quite mandatory.</li>
                            <li>Secondly, select a location where you would want to start your business.</li>
                        </ul><br>
                    <p>
                        As such, there is no registration required from the government in order to start a 
                        sole proprietorship business in India. You don’t need to fill up a form or submit 
                        any documents.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        <p>
                            However, the sole proprietorship business can only be established through opening 
                        a current account with a designated bank in the name of the firm and should obtain 
                        the licenses as per the nature of the business. In case you want to register your 
                        sole proprietorship business, you can do it as per the following:
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Registration under Shop and Establishment Act:</h3><br>
                        <p>If you own a shop from where goods are sold either by retail or wholesale 
                            to the customers or any services are provided to the customer, then you 
                            can register your business under the Shop and Establishment Act by making 
                            an application to the Local Municipal Corporation of your city/place of 
                            business.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Registration under MSME:</h3><br>
                        <p>You can register your business through Udhyog Aadhar under the Ministry of

                        <p>You can apply for GST registration which is completely optional if the 
                            turnover of your business is less than Rs. 20 lakhs. In case you apply 
                            for GST registration, then it is mandatory for you to meet all the 
                            compliances.
                        </p>
