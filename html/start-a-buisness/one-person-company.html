                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>The introduction of OPC in the legal system is a move that would encourage corporatization of micro businesses 
                        and entrepreneurship with a simpler legal regime so that the small entrepreneur is not forced to devote 
                        considerable time, energy and resources on complex legal compliances. This will not only enable individual 
                        capabilities to contribute economic growth, but also generate employment opportunity. With the implementation 
                        of the Companies Act, 2013, a single national person can constitute a Company, under the One Person Company 
                        (OPC) concept.
                    <p>

                <div class="intro">
                    <h2>What is a One Person Company (OPC)?</h2>
                    <p>
                        As per section 2(62) of the Companies Act, 2013, “One Person Company” means a company which has only one person as a member. <br>
                        With the passage of time, the OPC mode of business organization is all set to become the most preferred form of business 
                        organization. The benefits arising from this novel concept are many, to name a few – 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Minimal paperwork and less number of compliances</li>
                            <li>Ability to form a separate legal entity with just one member</li>
                            <li>Provision for conversion to other types of legal entities by the 
                                introduction of more members and amendments in the Memorandum of Association.</li>
                        </ul><br>
                    <p>
                        The One Person Company concept would hold a bright future for small traders, entrepreneurs, artisans, 
                        other service providers with low risk-taking capacity. The OPC would act as a launchpad for such 
                        entrepreneurs to showcase their capabilities in the global arena. The foreign joint venture capitalists 
                        are going to find it quite feasible to deal with a sole entrepreneur rather than having to even it out 
                        with numerous shareholders/directors leading to chances of discrepancy in ideas, concepts, and understanding 
                        of the business. <br>
