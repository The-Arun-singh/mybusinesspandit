                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Limited Liability Partnership Firm (LLP) is a unique entity form of business entity that is easy to incorporate with a 
                        minimum of two partners and involves less post-registration compliance and maintenance as compared to any other form 
                        of business. To overcome the risk of unlimited liability, LLP formation came into the picture. If a start-up is not 
                        keen to raise funds and wants less stress on the compliance part, then they can opt for LLP. <br>
                        LLP is an alternative business vehicle that gives the benefits of limited liability company and flexibility of a 
                        partnership firm. Since LLP contains elements of both ‘a corporate structure’ as well as ‘partnership firm structure’; 
                        it is many a time termed as a mixture of a company and a partnership. LLP is a separate legal entity that can continue 
                        its existence irrespective of changes in its partners. LLP is an incorporated partnership formed and registered under 
                        the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008.

                        <h2>ADVANTAGES</h2>
                        <p>Not just one or two but there numerous reasons why you should go for LLP. Let's find out what they are:</p>

                            <h3>Separate Legal Entity</h3>
                            <p>An LLP is a separate legal entity just like companies. It follows the principle of perpetual succession. 
                                The entry and exit of a new partner or existing one does not dissolve its existence. Furthermore, the assets 
                                of the business are not owned by any of the partners.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="cell c2">
                            <h3>Limited Liability</h3>
                            <p>The liability of each partner is limited to the contribution made by the partner. It means that if the LLP incur 
                                any losses, then the personal assets of the LLP’s partners won’t be seized. Also, they would not be required need 
                                to pay for those losses.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="cell c3">
                            <h3>No requirement of Minimum Capital Contribution</h3>
                            <p>To start an LLP, you don’t need to keep up with any minimum capital requirement. You can start your 
                                LLP with as low as one rupee. Hence, the cost of forming an LLP is very low.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="cell c4">
                            <h3>Less Compliance</h3>
                            <p>There are very Few compliances and regulations in comparison to any other form of an entity like a private company or Public Company.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>Easy transfer of ownership</h3>
                            <p>In an LLP, it’s quite easy to transfer ownership to others. Unlike the traditional partnership firm where the addition of new 
                                partners affects its existence, in an LLP things are completely opposite.</p>

                            <p>In LLP, there is no requirement of conducting Audit. The need for audit arises only during the following two situations: <br>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>When the annual turnover of the business crosses the limit of Rs. 40 lakhs, or</li>
